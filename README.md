Introduction:

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the To-Do List Web Application! In this guide, you'll find detailed explanations of the project structure, code functionality, and user interactions. The To-Do List Web Application is a practical tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aimed at helping users manage their tasks efficiently. By following this documentation, you'll gain insights into the development process and learn how to create a user-friendly interface for task management.

Project Overview:
The To-Do List Web Application provides users with a platform to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It features a clean and intuitive interface, making task organization effortless. With dynamic filtering options, users can easily focus on pending or completed tasks, enhancing productivity. This project is an excellent opportunity to showcase your web development skills and create a valuable tool for personal or professional use.

Features:
1. Add Task: Users can input new tasks into the provided text field and add them to the to-do list with a simple click of a button. This feature enables users to quickly capture tasks as they come to mind, ensuring nothing gets overlooked.

2. Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking a checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough effect, providing users with a clear indication of their progress.

3. Delete Task: Individual tasks can be deleted from the to-do list by clicking a delete button associated with each task. This feature allows users to remove tasks that are no longer relevant or necessary.

4. Delete Selected: Users have the option to delete all completed tasks at once with the "Delete Selected" button. This bulk deletion feature streamlines task management and helps users maintain a clutter-free to-do list.
